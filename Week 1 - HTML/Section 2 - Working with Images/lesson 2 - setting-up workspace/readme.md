In HTML images are defined with the Image tag.

The Image tag contains attributes only, and does not have a closing tag.

The src attribute defines the url (web address) of the image. You can use PNG, JPEG or GIF image files. Make sure you specify the correct image file name in the src attribute.

Remember: the image name is always case sensitive. In other words, if your image is called “Car.jpg” (with an uppercase “c”) and you type “car.jpg” (with a lower case “c”) then your image will not be found.
